# Holders

The **_STFIL Protocol_** will mint stFIL tokens, which are derivative tokens representing stake FIL; it allows holders to stake their FIL assets into smart contracts to mint a 1:1 stake token stFIL, This is a derivative token based on EIP-2612 (an extension of ERC-20). It represents the right to claim staked FIL. And stFIL does not need to be locked! After users hold stFIL, no matter where they are obtained from, stFIL will accumulate staking rewards.

Users can exchange stFIL for FIL at any time as long as there is sufficient liquidity to cover the swap. In the case of market risks caused by the limited liquidity of FIL, stFIL's price in the secondary market can still provide sufficient confidence to holders due to fluctuations in supply and demand.

stFIL can be used and traded like other ERC-20 tokens. Users can do anything they want with it, including holding, selling, trading, and lending. This provides users with higher capital efficiency and utility, as it allows holders to earn staking rewards while also being able to use stFIL in DeFi.

STFIL protocol provides loans to Storage Provider nodes for sector pledge using FIL from the liquidity pool.  Storage Providers use a portion of the block rewards they receive to pay interest to stFIL holders.  STFIL Protocol aggregates the penalties and losses of all nodes and amortizes each user equally, minimizing the impact on individual users.  Penalties are first covered by the balance of node provided by Storage Providers, followed by the risk reserve fund of the STFIL, and finally by stFIL holders in the pool.

Currently, STFIL protocol is designed to accept a minimum of 1 FIL tokens for staking, with no maximum limit.

Hurry up to stake your FIL to earn liquidity income and enjoy the value-added brought by time.
