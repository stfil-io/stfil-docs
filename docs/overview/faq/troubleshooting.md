# ðŸ“Œ Troubleshooting


### I cannot connect to the platform
- Make sure to select the correct network (Filecoin Mainnet). Normally on the wallet provider you can switch the network in the settings option.

- On Ledger natively or over Metamask:

    + Make sure to unlock and select Ethereum app.

    + Make sure contract data is allowed on the Ethereum app settings.

- Coinbase

    + Use the scan QR option to connect.

  + If you want to access directly from Coinbase wallet just go to app.aave.com on the browser within the app.

- Wallet connect

    + Use the scan QR code to connect

### Enable contract data on Ledger
Make sure to select the Filecoin app and enable contract data.

To enable contract data:

- Connect and unlock your Ledger device.

- Open the Ethereum application.

- Press the right button to navigate to Settings.

- Then press both buttons to validate.

- In the Contract data settings, press both buttons to allow contract data in transactions.

- The device displays Allowed.

### I cannot send transactions
Make sure you have enough FIL in your wallet to interact with the platform.You must have FIL in your wallet for the transaction **costs**-- without it you won't be able to interact. Depending on the network status, the cost of the transactions may vary. At least 0.01 FIL may be required to interact properly.

### The site does not load
The following steps may solve your problems:

- If you are using Brave browser, switch to another browser to see if the issues are coming from the browser. If it is related to Brave browser some helpful actions are:

    + Clearing cache data and cookies for the site

    + Hard refresh with control + F5 (or cmd + r)

    + Disable brave wallet (or the wallet not being used as default, for example metamask, dapper, etc.)or other extensions that might be interfering with proper connection with the wallet

    + If the site still won't load after taking the steps above, you will have to use the platform in another browser.

- Make sure your internet connection is working and stable

- Restart the browser and try to connect again

- Try to hard refresh the site with control + F5

- Check if there are any updates for your browser or wallet provider. If so, update it to the latest version. 

In this situation make sure to not keep sending transactions, as every new transaction will be stuck pending the oldest transaction to be confirmed. You can get rid of the stuck transaction by speeding it up or cancelling it. Depending on the wallet you are using, you may have that option natively.

For example, metamask or trust wallet have both the options to cancel or speed up transactions.
