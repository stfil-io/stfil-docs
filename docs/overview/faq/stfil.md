# Introduce to STFIL


### What is STFIL？
STFIL is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers.  Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while SPs are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion.
Please join the STFIL community Discord server;  the STFIL team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use STFIL.

### Why STFIL?
The STFIL protocol has completed a security audit. The protocol is completely open source, allowing anyone to interact with it through a user interface client, API, or directly with the smart contracts on the Filecoin network. Being open source means that you can build any third-party services or applications to interact with the protocol and enhance your products.

### How do I interact with STFIL protocol?？
To interact with the STFIL protocol, you simply need to provide your preferred asset and amount. Holders of the currency will receive passive income based on market borrowing demand. Additionally, it allows you to borrow using SP as collateral. The block rewards you earn by providing funds on the Filecoin network help offset the interest you accumulate by borrowing FIL.

### What is the cost of interacting with STFIL protocol?
Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for Filecoin Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity.

### Where are the funds I provide deposited?
Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, formally verified and audited by third-party auditors. SP can repay the loan according to the actual situation, put FIL into the public fund pool, and users can withdraw funds from the pool on demand.

### Is there any risk?
No platform can be considered entirely risk free. The risks related to the STFIL platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process). Every possible step has been taken to minimise the risk as much as possible-- the protocol code is public and open source and it has been audited. Additionally, there is an ongoing bug bounty campaign live and running.

You can find additional risk and security related information in the risk framework and security and audits sections.

### What is stFIL token？
The STFIL protocol will mint stFIL tokens, which are derivative tokens representing stake FIL; it allows holders (assets) to stake their FIL assets into smart contracts to mint a 1:1 stake token stFIL, This is a derivative token based on EIP-2612 (an extension of ERC-20). It represents the right to claim staked FIL. And stFIL does not need to be locked! After users hold stFIL, no matter where they are obtained from, stFIL will accumulate staking rewards.

Documentation on tokenomics and governance is available in the flash paper and with further detail in the full documentation. Feel free to join the discussion in the governance forum.

### Mobile App
Be careful, STFIL doesn't have any downloadable mobile application available. If you find one, it is a scam. STFIL Protocol would not ask for your seed passphrase ever.

STFIL never advertises on any social media or search engine. If you see any advertisement, those are scams and phishing sites.
