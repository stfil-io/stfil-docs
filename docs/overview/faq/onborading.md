# ðŸ“Œ SP Onborading


### Why onborading?
In order to ensure the financial security of stFIL holders, storage providers can only obtain loan qualifications after completing the onboarding process and delegating the owner or beneficiary address of the node to the STFIL smart contract. The smart contract will calculate the borrowable amount of the node according to the actual situation(the balance of the node, the amount of pledges, etc.). After onboarding, SP can initiate a loan at any time. And leave after all debts are paid off, regaining full ownership of the node.

### What is required for node onboarding?
During the onboarding process:

1. Delegate beneficiary address: You need to have the private key of the nodeâ€™s beneficiary address, and follow the prompts to change the nodeâ€™s beneficiary address to the new address provided by the STFIL smart contract. Enrollment is now complete.

2. Delegated owner address: First, you need to make sure that the owner of the node and the beneficiary are the same address. Second, you must use the owner's private key, and follow the prompts to change the node's owner address to the new address provided by the STFIL smart contract. Enrollment is now complete.
### How much loan can a node get?

1.  Delegate beneficiary address: After onboarding, you can get a loan line of 33% of the FIL assets of the node. After completing KYC, a maximum loan amount of 150% of node FIL assets can be obtained.

2.  Delegated owner addressï¼šAfter onboarding, you can get a loan line of 50% of the FIL assets of the node. After completing KYC, a maximum loan amount of 200% of node FIL assets can be obtained.

### How to redeem a node?
At any time, as long as all debts of the node have been paid off, the node operator can follow the prompts on the webpage to complete the resignation operation and get back the ownership of the node.

### How to get a loan with a high amount?
If storage providers want to obtain higher loans for their node, they need to submit the KYC form to STFIL DAO for review. A storage provider that passes KYC represents a higher credit value. You can get a higher loan.

### Why KYC?
Through KYC, STFIL DAO can gain a deeper understanding of the SP's team/company situation. Once a node meets a problem and causes a loss, DAO can get in touch with the storage provider in time to negotiate a feasible solution. In this way, further expansion of losses can be effectively avoided, and the stability of the Filecoin storage network can be improved while ensuring the security of users' funds.

### What aspects does the KYC review include??

1.  The operation and maintenance capabilities of storage providers, especially large storage providers.

2.  The nodeâ€™s historical performance.

3.  Geographical and Jurisdictional Distribution.

4.  How keys and other security aspects are managed.
