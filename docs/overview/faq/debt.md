# Debt Type

For ***Assets*** ：

➯ _**Only ARY**_ ，users only care about how much FIL they have invested in the STFIL liquidity pool, and do not need to care about which SP borrowed their funds. This is completely transparent to the user. And the user's funds are compounded.

For ***storage provider SP***, you can choose different debt models according to your actual situation:

➯ _**Stable Debt Mode**_, during the entire cycle of using funds, the interest rate ratio of this fund will be executed in accordance with the stable loan interest rate ratio calculated in the contract at the time of loan, and will not change.

➯ _**Variable debt model**_, FIL price fluctuations will affect SP's willingness to borrow, and the utilization rate of funds will affect the loan interest rate, which is interlocking. The interest rate on variable debt will fluctuate from moment to moment due to the availability of funds.
