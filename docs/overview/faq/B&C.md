# Background&Challenges

In October 2020, Filecoin, a distributed storage project that has attracted much attention, successfully reached the block height of 148888, announcing that the main network was officially launched. Since the launch of the mainnet, it has experienced tremendous growth. The effective computing power of the entire network has exceeded 18EiB, and more than 3,900 miners have participated in mining. A total of more than 1.45 million currency-holding accounts have been developed, of which more than 150,000 currency-holders have an account balance greater than 10FIL .

### Challenge One
In the Filecoin network, staking can improve the service quality of the entire network. It is the cornerstone of building a robust, stable, and well-experienced distributed storage network. Only then can it challenge the centralized storage market. User Loss. Compared with Bitcoin and other networks, Filecoin's PoSt consensus mechanism is also the key to providing stable storage, requiring Storage Providers to have more professional hardware equipment, more professional computer room sites, more professional operation and maintenance engineers, more stable power equipment, and more expensive The initial investment has created a high threshold for Filecoin Storage Provider. Only companies or teams that can support large amounts of funds and resources can participate.

### Challenge Two
In order to adapt to multi-dimensional capabilities and high costs, Storage Providers are also unwilling to bear the risk of currency price fluctuations by investing funds to purchase a large number of pledged coins.
Nowadays, it is rare for a single investor to complete all the work of SP. When the market holds excess infrastructure, a multi-role joint mining model appears in the market. It is composed of a part of token holders who expect the value of fil to increase, and a part of a team with equipment and a technical team with operation and maintenance capabilities to cooperate with each other. They agree on the income distribution ratio based on the current currency price and equipment cost.
However, the centralized service model is full of uncertainties and unknown risks, and the income is opaque. Due to currency price fluctuations, the operation and maintenance party may make ends meet, and the operation and maintenance party holds the SP Owner wallet to do evil and other problems. These situations happen occasionally. The key contradiction is "centralization".

### Challenge Three
The pledged FIL is unleveraged, static, and difficult to compound interest, which is a manifestation of capital inefficiency. Token holders also have to passively wait for the end of the pledge period due to the duration of Filecoinâ€™s sector (pledge period), and it is difficult to obtain liquidity when funds are needed. Let a large number of currency holders' funds be more willing to retain liquidity, expecting to be rewarded in the fluctuation of the currency price. At the same time, the behavior of forcibly terminating the sector in order to obtain liquidity seriously affects the Filecoin network quality and user information, and may cause the price of FIL to fall in severe cases.

### Challenge Four
Retail investors are also an important part of the Filecoin network. They are optimistic about the future of Filecoin, but due to the limited number of FIL held, it is always difficult to participate in joint pledge. This leaves them with no choice but to keep FIL in their wallets.
