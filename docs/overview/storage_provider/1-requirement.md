#  Requirement

**_STFIL Protocol_** requires that storage providers must already run nodes before lending; assets from the current node should be used as collateral to obtain loan qualifications from the protocol. The protocol strictly restricts the borrowed FIL to only be used for sector pledge commitments. Any storage provider can join the agreement and qualify for a loan under this premise.

If the storage provider wants to obtain a higher loan amount, it needs to improve KYC and submit it to STFIL DAO for review. Audits include the following aspects:

➱ The operation and maintenance capabilities of storage providers, especially large storage providers.

➱ The node’s historical performance.

➱ Geographical and Jurisdictional Distribution.

➱ How keys and other security aspects are managed.

➱ ...

Storage providers can obtain different maximum loan leverage by delegating Owner/Beneficiary addresses to the DAO.
