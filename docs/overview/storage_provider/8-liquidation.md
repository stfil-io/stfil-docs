#  Liquidation

STFIL Protocol will allow storage provider nodes whose node assets are below the threshold to be liquidated, and the STFIL Protocol allows anyone to become a liquidator. The existence of liquidators helps to promote the stability of the STFIL protocol, because they can ensure that bad debts can be properly dealt with, while reducing the risk exposure of the protocol. Users can increase their participation by becoming a liquidator and earn benefits from it.
Therefore, node loss will have two phases:
In the first stage, the entire loss is borne by the storage provider, covering a small amount of loss during the operation of the node.
In the second stage, the liquidator will liquidate the debt of the node on the basis that the ratio of the total debt to the total assets remains constant.
After the storage provider repays all debts, the pledged node can be redeemed and full ownership of the node can be regained.
