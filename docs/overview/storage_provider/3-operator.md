#  Node Operator

For security considerations, we divide the node roles into node owner and node operator. Node owner are responsible for sensitive node management operations such as delegating miner owner, undelegating miner owner, etc, while node operator are responsible for everyday operations such as borrowing, repayments, withdrawal, etc.
