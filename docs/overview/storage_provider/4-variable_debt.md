# Variable Rate Debt

_**Variable debt model**_, FIL price fluctuations will affect SP's willingness to borrow, and the utilization rate of funds will affect the loan interest rate, which is interlocking. The interest rate on variable debt will fluctuate from moment to moment due to the availability of funds.

_**Variable debt model**_ is debt whose interest rate changes over time based on fluctuations in the underlying benchmark interest rate or other specified factors. The interest rate on variable-rate debt typically changes on a regular basis.

One advantage of floating-rate debt is that it may offer a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate debt, making it a more affordable option for borrowers. However, floating-rate debt can also expose borrowers to greater risk than fixed-rate debt because interest rates can change over time. If interest rates rise, borrowers on floating-rate debt may see their interest payments increase, which could lead to higher borrowing costs, and vice versa.

Overall, variable rate debt is a useful vehicle for borrowers who are willing to accept a degree of interest rate risk in exchange for the potential cost savings of a lower initial rate. Borrowers should carefully consider their risk tolerance and financial situation before choosing floating rate debt over fixed rate debt.
