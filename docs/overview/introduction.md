**_STFIL protocol_** is a first of its kind FIL Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in FVM.

The **_STFIL protocol_** mainly attracts two types of groups; those who want to obtain income without sacrificing liquidity performance participate in staking with tokenization and teams with high-quality hardware and operation and maintenance resources, hoping to provide services to obtain a higher return on investment;

For more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend [reading article one in our explainer series](https://medium.com/@contacts_5594/stfil-decentralized-liquidity-staking-protocol-for-filecoin-6c0b26621ead) that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol.

The core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party.The _**STFIL protocol**_ brings together FIL holders and storage providers to share Filecoin block rewards. This is a win-win choice.

**_STFIL protocol_** expects every user to join, whether it is a FIL holder or an SP with operation and maintenance capabilities. Let us maintain a strong and stable distributed storage network together and share the block rewards brought by the Filecoin network.
