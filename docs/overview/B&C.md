# ðŸŒ‘ Background&Challenges

In March 2023, Filecoin, a distributed storage network, successfully launched the Filecoin Virtual Machine. The Filecoin protocol has experienced tremendous growth since mainnet launch in October 2020, and currently, has 19EiB of total power from over 3,800 storage providers. Among Filecoin Token Holders, there are nearly 160,000 who hold at least 10 FIL in their wallets.

### _Challenge â… _
In the Filecoin network, pledge can improve the service quality of the network. This is the cornerstone of building a robust, stable, and well-experienced distributed storage network. Only then can it challenge the centralized storage market. 
Compared with Bitcoin and other networks, The PoSt consensus mechanism of Filecoin is also the key to providing stable storage, it requires Storage Providers to have more professional hardware equipment, more professional computer room sites, more professional operation and maintenance engineers, more stable power equipment. Additionally, more expensive initial investment has created a high threshold for Filecoin Storage Provider which lead to only companies or teams that can support large amounts of funds and resources can participate .

### _Challenge â…¡_
In order to adapt to multi-dimensional capabilities and high costs, Storage Providers are unwilling to funds to purchase a large number of FIL for pledging which may bear the risk of FIL price fluctuations.
Nowadays, it is rare for only a single role to support all the work of Storage Provider. When there is a surplus of hardware devices on the market, a multi-role mining model appears. It is composed of a part of token holders who expect the value of fil to increase(unwilling to sell), and a part of teams with equipment and technical capabilities. They agree on the rewards distribution ratio based on the current currency price and equipment cost.
However, the centralized service model is full of uncertainties and risks, and the income is always opaque. Due to the fluctuations of FIL price, the  maintenance party may break the pale(due to the constant  ratio agreed at the beginning of cooperation ). and the maintenance party holds the Owner wallet to do evil and other unknown risks. These situations happen occasionally. The key contradiction is "centralization".

### _Challenge â…¢_
Pledge in Fielcoin network is unleveraged, static, and difficult to compound interest, which is a manifestation of capital inefficiency. FIL holders also have to wait passively for the end of the pledge period due to the duration of Filecoinâ€™s sector (pledge period), and it is difficult to obtain liquidity when funds are needed. So, a part of FIL holders are more willing to retain liquidity, expecting to be rewarded in the fluctuation of the FIL price. Addtionally, the behavior of terminating the sector for liquidity seriously affects the Filecoin network quality and user confidenc. It may cause the price of FIL to fall in severe cases.
### _Challenge â…£_
We often overlook the fact that retail investors are  an important part of the Filecoin network. They are optimistic about the future of Filecoin, but always difficult to participate in joint pledge due to the limited number of FIL held. This leaves them with no choice but to keep FIL in their wallets.
