# STFIL Document Hub

STFIL DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built for liquidity staking on the Filecoin network. It aims to be community-owned, decentralized, trustless, and compatible with staking on Filecoin. STFIL allows users to earn block rewards without locking assets or maintaining storage provider infrastructure.

In the Filecoin network, staking improves the overall quality of service and is the cornerstone of building a robust, stable, and user-friendly distributed storage network that can challenge the centralized storage market and effectively compensate for user losses. Compared to other networks such as Bitcoin, Filecoin's PoSt consensus mechanism is also critical for providing stable storage, requiring storage providers to have more professional hardware equipment, more professional data center sites, more professional operations engineers, more stable power equipment, and higher initial investment. This has created a high barrier to entry for Filecoin storage providers, with only companies or teams that can afford the necessary resources and funding being able to participate.

The STFIL liquidity staking protocol is a Filecoin liquidity staking protocol that addresses these shortcomings. Users can deposit their FIL into the STFIL smart contract and receive stFIL tokens, a token that represents staked FIL, which can be used to receive rewards from Filecoin storage providers. Storage providers can stake their nodes to obtain liquidity for the staked FIL in their nodes and qualify for borrowing FIL from STFIL to earn more mining profits with greater operations. Then, a DAO-controlled smart contract will stake the tokens with the storage providers selected by the DAO. The funds deposited by users are controlled by the DAO, and storage providers can never directly access users' assets.

Unlike staked FIL, stFIL tokens are not restricted by liquidity and can be transferred at any time. The stFIL token balance is calculated based on the total amount of staked FIL, plus rewards, and minus any penalties. STFIL is a more flexible solution than existing options, allowing users to deposit any amount of FIL they want to earn rewards. STFIL only charges a 3% fee on Filecoin node rewards (regulated by the DAO), and the number of staked FIL and stFIL issued is fully transparent and auditable, managed by the private keys of the DAO's multisignature wallet, and not controlled by any one party. It is a decentralized liquidity staking method.

In the current crypto and DeFi industry, although Lido and Rocket Pool have similar stories, they only serve the world outside of Filecoin. On the eve of the release of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), our team has made sufficient preparations, and STFIL has no competitors. Our business is also an essential member of the Filecoin ecosystem and will receive widespread attention, even from the Filecoin Foundation.
