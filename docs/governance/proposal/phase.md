# Proposal Phase

### Stage 1: SIP Proposal

The SIP idea is submitted as an issue on GitHub, and the individual or individuals who submit the SIP idea are referred to as the authors. Please note that multiple members can work together on a single SIP idea, but it can only be submitted once. The ASIP idea is informally collected for comments on GitHub for 7 days. Authors cannot edit the original post - if they want to make changes to the original idea, they must do so through comments.

### Stage 2: Review

The SIP draft is reviewed by a project management team hired by the STFIL Foundation, which provides a SIP analysis report to ensure that costs, implementation steps, legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interest, and any further impact have been identified. As SIP authors may submit drafts with almost no resources, this service of the DAO community ensures that DAO members have sufficient information about the proposal to make informed decisions when voting.

The SIP draft + analysis report (DAR) package is reviewed by a group of administrators and approved or rejected based on whether it complies with the guidelines approved by the DAO. If approved, it becomes a pending SIP and enters Stage 3. If not approved, it is eligible for resubmission, except in cases of legal violations or reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information.

### Stage 3: Marking After Review

Pending SIPs that have passed the SIP review process are marked as "Ready for Voting." The "Ready for Voting" label is given to pending SIPs whose costs, content, and impact are considered straightforward and without risk to the DAO. Any pending SIP marked as "Ready for Voting" will move to Stage 4.

### Stage 4: Voting

Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes become live SIP snapshots during the next SIP publishing period. After going live on Snapshot, Live SIPs are open for voting until the weekly voting period ends. Administrators are the only ones who can publish SIPs on Snapshot as they must confirm that everyone has gone through the correct approval process.

### Stage 5: Results

If a Live SIP receives no votes or is tied at the end of the voting period, it is marked as "Stalled" and is eligible for resubmission. In all other cases, the Live SIP moves to one of two final SIP categories. If the author contacts the administrator, the rejected final SIP can be resubmitted through the appropriate resubmission template. Accepted final SIPs move into the implementation stage.

### Stage 6: Implementation

For accepted final SIPs, implementation begins according to the steps outlined in the SIP template. The project management team hired by the STFIL Foundation is responsible for ensuring that this happens, but they are not responsible for doing it themselves.
