# Voting Process

The administrator publishes the SIP to FilSnapshot after making sure everyone goes through the correct approval process. A new SIP is released every Thursday at 9pm. This is also when the six-day voting window opens. DAO members vote on snapshots. One FDAO equals one vote. Since votes cannot be divided into fractions, and the total number of votes should not exceed the number of tokens minted, if a voter has a fractional amount of tokens (ie, 100.1 tokens will generate 100 votes, 100.9 tokens). The voting options for Live SIP are "Yes" and "No". A vote "yes" means the voter approves of implementing SIP exactly as it is. Voting "No" means voting against implementing the AIP exactly as it is - you can vote "No" to encourage authors to resubmit the SIP after making changes.

Voting on each proposal in the weekly batch will be open for voting for six days, ending next Wednesday at 9pm. Proposals that receive a majority of "yes" votes will advance to the implementation phase. Rejected proposals will have the opportunity to be resubmitted via the appropriate resubmission template if the author contacts a moderator to initiate this process. If a Live SIP does not receive any votes or ties by the voting close time, it will be marked as "stalled" and eligible for resubmission.
