# Voting Proxy

DAO members can delegate their votes to another DAO member who they consider to be a trusted subject matter expert.
Voting delegation is a solution to the problem of low voter participation, voters who do not have time to actively participate in community activities can delegate their votes to delegates of consistent value and have their votes counted.
