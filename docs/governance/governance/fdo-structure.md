# Governance Structure

In order to simplify day-to-day governance operations, some activities of STFIL DAO are managed by the FDAO Committee.

Transactions from the Commission are usually conducted through XXX. Voting on XXX is based on the veto principle. We put a motion up for a vote, and if more than 10% of the votes reject a motion, it stops. Otherwise, it may be promulgated.
Committees must publicly report on their activities in research forums.

### FDAO Committee

The committee is made up of community members who hold FDAOs. Every community member holding FDAO is an equity holder of the STFIL community. While FDAO members enjoy community dividends, they also undertake the main task of maintaining the DAO community. Activities range from translating articles, creating mockups, to conducting organic outreach. In fact, FDAO committees can vote on various aspects of the agreement, such as grants, event funding, moderator funding, translations, outreach, and other community-related matters that promote and nurture the growth of STFIL.

### SP Committee

The committee consists of Storage Providers (SPs) participating in the STFIL liquidity pool. SP is the basic guarantee of the STFIL mining pool. The active participation of SP to maintain the security and stability of the STFIL mining pool cluster can ensure the benefits of users and promote the prosperity of STFIL. Therefore, SPs should actively participate in DAO to fight for their own interests, and STFIL DAO should also actively understand the needs of the majority of SPs and listen to the opinions of SPs.

### stFil Committee

The stfil committee is composed of all users who hold stfil, and stfil holders are the foundation of stfil DAO and are the end users.
