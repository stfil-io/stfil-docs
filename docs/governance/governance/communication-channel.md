# Communication Channel

The STFIL Foundation website is the hub of the DAO, providing an interface to inform DAO members about the governance process and providing easy access to the following channels to simplify the operation of the DAO and enhance its utility.

Forum is the first stop for all proposals. A SIP (STFIL Improvement Proposal) idea is submitted as a thread in Discourse and must be validated, proving that it meets the DAO-approved guidelines before it can appear in the community. STFIL holders must go through the wallet verification process in order to post ideas or provide feedback on ideas through comments.

Snapshots are used for voting. Draft proposals that have passed their respective approval processes are available for voting on Snapshot. FDO holders must pass the wallet verification process in order to vote.
