STFIL DAO will issue a token, and FDO is a token that grants governance rights in STFIL. Members of DAO become participants in organizational activities by holding Token, and share the fees charged by STFIL to obtain due returns. To a certain extent, the state of co-governance and sharing of owners and workers is realized.
In the governance vote of STFIL DAO, its governance token FDO must be held. FDO voting weight is related to the number of FDO held, and different types of holders will receive different weights. Holders can entrust their FDO to others to participate in the governance of the community.
The voting rules and weights of STFIL DAO can be upgraded and changed through DAO voting.
