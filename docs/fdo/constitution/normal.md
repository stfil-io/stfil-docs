# General Guidelines

Each year, the DAO conducts a vote to determine which DAO members will serve on a special committee of the STFIL Foundation (the DAO's "board"). The purpose of the Board is to manage the DAO proposal and serve the vision of the community. The initial board will only serve six months.

Board members can be removed and replaced before their term ends, based on a majority vote of token holders.

The total cost of implementation must be known before a proposal can be voted on.

DAO members must search past proposals to ensure that any ideas they intend to write proposals for have not yet been submitted.

If a proposed proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently being voted on, the second proposal should not be voted on until a decision is made on the first, to avoid the requirement to approve the objection.

Proposal proposals that directly conflict with another approved proposal cannot be voted on for three months after the original proposal is implemented, so as not to waste community assets.

Proposals will not be voted on if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, or are inconsistent with the mission or values of the APE Foundation.
