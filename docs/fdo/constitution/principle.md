# Constitutional Principles

1. STFIL DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization. Its overarching goal is to bring a solid and reliable reserve currency to every corner of the world in a decentralized, accessible manner.

2. The governance principle is meritocracy and democratic supervision of FDO holders. We believe that a governance structure that values and emphasizes the input of knowledgeable and dedicated individuals deeply immersed in the STFIL DAO community will inherently lead to the best outcomes for the entire DAO and all FDO holders. Executive rights are held by those who have contributed most to the success of the protocol.

3. The DAO expects governance participants to operate and communicate with integrity and mutual respect.

4. Proposals and discussions should be supported by sound arguments, facts and data.

5. When considering how to vote and govern, the following core question should be asked: "What maximizes the long-term well-being of the STFIL DAO community?" This should be the main guiding principle underpinning overall governance.

6. As a DAO, we reject any form of harassment. Any abuse against anyone in the STFIL DAO community will be severely punished and affected.

7. Governance should be on-chain and off-chain. The DAO strives to establish most of the consensus, and vote and execute most of the decisions on the chain.
