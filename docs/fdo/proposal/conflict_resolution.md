# Conflict Resolution

If a proposed proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently being voted on, the second proposal should not be voted on until a decision has been made on the first proposal to avoid approving contradictory demands.

Proposals that directly conflict with another approved proposal should not be voted on within three months of the original proposal's implementation to avoid wasting community assets.
