# Introduction

### What is STFILï¼Ÿ
STFIL is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers.  Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while SPs are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion.
Please join the STFIL community Discord server;  the STFIL team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use STFIL.
