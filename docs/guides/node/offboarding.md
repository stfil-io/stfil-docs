On the offboarding page, select your wallet to sign and return the signed result to the form. Submit a changeOwner/changeBeneficiary message through the Staking Pool, and have the old owner wallet sign it. This tutorial is for offboarding a multi-signature wallet, which requires two wallets to complete the signature operation. If it is a regular wallet, only one wallet can complete it.

After the Staking Pool submits the changeOwner/changeBeneficiary message, the old owner wallet should send a confirmation message accepting the new owner/beneficiary and sign it.
