# Introduction

Understand the composition of Fil wallet address and set up your 0x/f4 wallet. Understand the support of each exchange for 0x/f4 wallet address.

## Understand FIL Wallet Addresses

### FIL Addresses

#### FIL addresses have some unique elements from other blockchains:

Filecoin wallets have 5 address types: f0, f1, f2, f3, and f4. Note: A wallet address is a string of letters and numbers from which cryptocurrencies or NFTs can be sent to and from.

### How do I recognize the address type?

You can recognize the address type from any Filecoin address via what we call the “protocol indicator”. Put simply, this is the digit immediately following “f” on the address.

Example address: f1s5hbfgxihcbdj5jc35kv2eyoqpqdbahyo67ord
Since this digit immediately following “f” is 1, this is an f1 address type.

## Buy FIL and transfer to your 0x / f410 wallet

You can purchase FIL on centralized or decentralized exchanges.

it’s important to note that not all centralized exchanges that support FIL trading allow transfer to a 0x / f410 wallet at this point.

### Centralized Exchanges

0x / f410 addresses [launched with the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine on March 14 2023.](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/fvm-is-live-on-mainnet/) Since this is a recent upgrade, some exchanges do not yet support this new type of address. We expect that over time, most exchanges will support all Filecoin address types.


The list of exchanges below show which wallet address types each supports:

#### More About Exchanges

Any exchange that lists FIL for trading but is not listed above likely does not support 0x / f410 wallet addresses.

##### What happens if I make a FIL transfer to my 0x / f410 wallet address (e.g. Metamask) FROM an exchange not listed here?

The exchange will likely show either an error suggesting the address type cannot be validated or that the transfer is unsuccessful.

##### What happens if I make a FIL transfer from my 0x / f410 wallet (e.g. Metamask) TO an exchange not listed here?

If you transfer FIL from an f410 wallet address that the receiving exchange does not support, your transfer may not be displayed in your holdings. The FIL you sent will still exist at the receiving address but the exchange will not reflect your balance until they upgrade to recognize 0x / f410 wallet addresses.
